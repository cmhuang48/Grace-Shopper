## About

Chanelle Huang, Jiayu Zhang, Lauren Cagnetta, and Savannah Lin developed this e-commerce website for their bakery that offers cakes, cupcakes, and customized products.

Non-logged-in and logged-in customers can add items, remove items, edit cart, and checkout.

They will receive an order confirmation in their email, and logged-in customers can also view all their orders.

Admin users can add new products, remove products, and view all products and users.

Have a sweet time exploring our website!
